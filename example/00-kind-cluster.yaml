# this cluster config can be used to spin up a kind cluster e.g. with
# `kind create cluster --image kindest/node:v1.18.2 --config example/00-kind-cluster.yaml`
# It adds `host.docker.internal` to the API server cert's SANs, so it will be trusted by the the terraformer
# when running it in the dev container against the kind cluster (`host.docker.internal` is the easiest way of
# accessing the kind cluster from inside a docker container).
